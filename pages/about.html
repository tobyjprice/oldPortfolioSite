				<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I am a Games Programmer who recently graduated from the University of Lincoln with a First Class degree in Games Computing.  Having loved games since I was little, I never thought that I may be able to make games one day.  However after taking up Computing while at college and dipping my toe into programming, I realised that I had found a path to making games.  After applying to college with the goal of doing 'physics' as I claimed in my application letter, I chose to go to University and study games.
				<br><br>
				My interest in programming became even more apparent once I started.  I was drawn to the modules that focussed on coding tasks, rather than the more design oriented games modules.  The low level things we explored in second year, using SDL to build small games from scratch were deeply engaging.  Alongside this I did modules in Object-oriented programming and Algorithms.  They both showed me the software engineering side of programming, class diagrams and Big-O notation.  Further expanding my views on what programming is and how it can be tackled.</p>
