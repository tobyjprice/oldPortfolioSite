				<h4>A Pac-Man clone written in C++ and rendered using SDL 2.0</h4>
				<img src="images/pacman-clone_splash.png" alt="" width="100%">
				<p>Neon Dream is the name of my first C++ Game Programming project.  Created as part of the Games Programming module during my second year of University.  It uses SDL 2.0 to create the window and renderer.  The end result is a clone of Pac-Man with custom sprites and animations.  This was my first foray into lower level games programming, it helped to concentrate my focus on where I would like to take my career.</p>
				<h5>Key Features</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h6>Frame-rate independence</h6>
						<p>A core element of this project was exploring the traditional Game Loop.  Processing input, and updating the game objects independently of the frame rate.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Level loading and building</h6>
						<p>There are a few ways to approach the actual construction of the level.  I settled on a loading system that uses a simple text file as input.  Each block type is assigned a number and in this text file the numbers can be specified, allowing the user to place walls or pathways wherever they like.  In the future this could be expanded to include an interface with which to generate these levels.</p>
